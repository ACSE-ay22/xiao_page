                            Xiao Yan, a recent graduate from Imperial College London, has earned a Master's degree in Applied Computational Science & Engineering, building upon a solid foundation in Computer Science. Specializing in the intersection of computational methods and real-world applications, Xiao has honed skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development.
                            
                            During Xiao's tenure at Imperial College, the focus was on developing innovative solutions to complex problems, often exploring the optimization of algorithms for efficiency and accuracy. The drive for continual learning is matched by a commitment to contributing to the academic community through diligent research and collaboration.
                            
                            Xiao is currently seeking opportunities to extend this passion for computational science into a PhD program.
