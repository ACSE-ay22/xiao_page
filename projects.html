                        <h3>Wind farm layout optimization with the large size wind farm by Python (2023.6-2023.9) </h3>
                        <p>This study evaluates the performance of
                            various optimization algorithms GA(Genetic Algorithm), GHA(Greedy Heuristic Algorithm), and
                            RS(Random Search), to address this issue. Based on our validation, GA was chosen for its
                            effectiveness and employed to solve this intricate planning problem. Our findings confirm that
                            neighboring wind farms significantly influence each otherâ€™s performance and reveal that wind
                            speed significantly affects this influence. We prove that smaller turbines with shorter rotor
                            lengths can mitigate this impact.</p>

                        <h3>Mental support chatbot equiped with a camera by Python (2021.11 - 2022.3)</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project needs combines 3 models: a face detector, a face classifier,
                            and a conversational model. Face detectors do the task that detecting the human face in a
                            picture and outputting the face image. And face classifier is identifying the ques of facial
                            expression. Lastly, the conversation model could be regarded as a regular chatbot.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Parallel Implementation of Navier-Stokes Equation Solver using Message Passing Interface(MPI)</h3>
                        <p>In this project, we've developed a parallel solver for the Navier-Stokes equations using 
                            MPI for improved efficiency. Our focus was on fluid dynamics, 
                            breaking down the complex calculations across multiple processors.
                             This not only speeds up the process but also scales up for more intricate simulations. 
                             We've concentrated on ensuring the accuracy of our simulations while optimizing performance. 
                             This is crucial for applications in fields like engineering and physics. 
                             All the cases were test in the high performance computer (HPC) in Imperial College London.
                             Our work showcases how parallel computing can be effectively used to handle complex fluid dynamics problems, 
                             demonstrating a significant stride in the realm of scientific computation.</p>
